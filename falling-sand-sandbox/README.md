## About This Project

<br>

<p align="left">
  This is my personal attempt at recreating a common simulation method of physics using a grid-based system within Javascript.
  This project was built using the skills I've built in design practices in order to create a flexible sandbox experience with greater customization than external options.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  I was personally inspired to make this project from the game Noita, from its overall aesthetic to the plentiful interactions between game objects. 
  From this, I decided to create my own attempt at recreating that same feeling with the programming skills I have developed. 
  For this project, I decided to work in Javascript due to ease of rendering and accessibility to this project through the web.

### Built for Flexibility

<p>
  Within this sandbox, you can place and interact with various preset elements and customize them to your liking. Everything is built to be flexible. Controls have been added for easy access to augmenting the sandbox, allowing for expression of creativity. This freedom gives a lot of room to explore the capabilities of the simulation and its limits.

## Instructions

<p>
  You can access the demo from my <a href="https://quaidsage.com" target="_blank"><strong>website »</strong></a>. 
</p>

  * Left Click and drag across the left-hand game window to add elements to the grid.
  * Change elements from the right-hand button menu.
    * Access tools such as Increase Brush Size or Fill in the same menu.
  * Edit Element Behaviours such as Burn Rate and Acceleration in the Edit Settings window.
  * Select different Views or alter Render Delay to observe element behaviour in the bottom-right menu.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Support water and fire interactions.
- [ ] Ability to adjust movement and types of elements.
- [ ] Option to add more elements and save.
- [ ] Option to adjust grid row and column ratio.
- [ ] Further optimisations to drawing of elements.
- [ ] Image importing.
